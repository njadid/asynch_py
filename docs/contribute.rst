Contributing to development
---------------------------

If you want to deep dive and help out with development on Read the Docs, then first get the project installed locally according to the :ref:`Installation` instruction. After that is done we suggest you have a look at tickets in our issue tracker that are labelled `Good First Bug`_. These are meant to be a great way to get a smooth start and won't put you in front of the most complex parts of the system.

If you are up to more challenging tasks with a bigger scope, then there are a set of tickets with a `Enhancement`_ tag. These tickets have a general overview and description of the work required to finish. If you want to start somewhere, this would be a good place to start. That said, these aren't necessarily the easiest tickets. They are simply things that are explained. If you still didn't find something to work on, search for the `Sprintable`_ label. Those tickets are meant to be standalone and can be worked on ad-hoc.

When contributing code, then please follow the standard Contribution Guidelines set forth at `contribution-guide.org`_.
